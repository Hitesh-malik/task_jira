# React Task Management App

A simple task management application built with React, utilizing drag-and-drop functionality to manage tasks across different statuses: To Do, In Progress, and Completed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: You can add tasks using a modal form.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Move tasks between "To Do", "In Progress", and "Completed" lists using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Task Management**: Track and update the status of tasks as you work on them.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library to build the user interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the components.
- **HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API**: For task status updates with drag-and-drop (or you can optionally use `react-dnd` for more complex features).
